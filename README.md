# MPOwide
Frame for the M Prime One wide

I need to widen the MPO frame to hold the Bernis Simple Extruder I'm currently using instead of the official PTSone, and I also
want to put the power supply (a fanless LED supply, 12v 5A) screwed to the frame.
To get a wider frame, I've setup an OpenSCAD model that allows to extend the right side of the frame 30mm to hold the above.
To be able to cut it on a Laser Cutter, it's necessary to export the DXF 2D projection and convert it to SVG.
